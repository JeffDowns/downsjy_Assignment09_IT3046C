# IT3046C-17US-Lab-9

## Dependencies

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - I have tested on the LTS channel, which is anything v6.4+, but it should work perfectly fine on the v7 channel as well
2. (Optional) [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) - NOTE: I have included Jest as a dependency of this project, but you can install it globally if you would like using the following command

```
npm install -g jest
```

If you are having trouble installing it globally and are on a macOS/Linux machine, try running the command with `sudo`:

```
sudo npm install -g jest
```

## How to install

All of the dependencies are included in the `package.json` file, so all you need to run is the install command in your command prompt/terminal while in your project directory:

```
npm install
```

## How to run tests

You can run the tests by running the project's test command from inside your command prompt/terminal while in your project directory.

```
npm test
```
